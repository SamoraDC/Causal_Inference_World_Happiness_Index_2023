The Global Happiness Index through 2023 delivers an extensive and current analysis of happiness measures and the determinants affecting global well-being. Aimed at furnishing critical insights for decision-makers,
scholars, and those keen on exploring the nuances of happiness and welfare across the globe, 
this dataset serves as a pivotal resource for comprehending the complexities of contentment and quality of life internationally. The propose of this Analysis is to both shows the variables that is correlated to higher happiness score, 
and the estimated causal effect that each numerical variable on happiness score. 

## DataFrame

| Column | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| country | The name of the country |
| region | The geographic region or continent |
| happiness_score | A measure reflecting overall happiness |
| gdp_per_capita | A measure of Gross Domestic Product per capita |

## Tools 

It Was used the Jupyter Notebook (Python IDE) to host the analysis, and was used the following Python Libraries:

- Pandas is a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools. It is particularly suited for working with tabular data (similar to Excel spreadsheets).

- NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.

-  Matplotlib A plotting library that provides a MATLAB-like interface for making 2D plots from data. It is highly customizable and capable of creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

- Seaborn Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library designed to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data.

- SciPy is built on NumPy and provides additional functionality with submodules for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, and others.

-  Statsmodels focuses on statistical models, hypothesis tests, and data exploration. Statsmodels is great for conducting statistical tests and inferences.

- Plotly.express a high-level API for creating figures. It is designed to make the creation of complex, beautiful visualizations easy with a simple syntax, that can be manipulated live.

- DoWhy a library for causal inference that simplifies the use of advanced causal inference techniques. It provides a principled way to model your assumptions and estimate causal effects based on those assumptions, making it easier to apply causal analysis in practice.



## Propose of the Analysis

#### Bussiness Problem

The Cabinet Sub Secretary for the Foreign Relations Minister wants to do a report to the Minister, informing what makes the population happier. To do so, he contacts the Data Science Manager and explain he's demand.

The Manager contacts his Data Scientist which is Specialized in Econometry, the Manager knows that he is really busy with the prediction of gas price project, but the demand came from the Cabinet of the Foreign Relations Minister. So, it is priority.

Another thing that the Manager mentioned, is that the Sub Secretary needs this report ASAP, so you must hurry! ðŸ˜¢
